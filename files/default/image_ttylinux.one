The purpose of this image is to test OpenNebula deployments, without wasting network bandwith thanks to the tiny footprint of this image (40MB). The login information for this image is:\n\n* **login**: root\n* **password**: password\n\n **NOTE:** The contextualization of this image is really simple. You can not set the network mask or the gateway. It's always a C class and gateway is x.y.z.1."
